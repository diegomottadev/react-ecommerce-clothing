# Goal of this project

  The development of this project, along with the course tutor , was develop a Full Stack E-Commerce App built with React, using Firebase and Stripe API, where peoples can purchase their choosable clothes.

# The scope of this project

  To be honest, I don't remember how far I progressed with the project since it's been a while since I took the course by that author, and I couldn't complete it due to time constraints and the course being quite lengthy. Although I would love to share the course link, it seems that it's not available on Google anymore. However, I did find the original repository at https://github.com/lgope/fashion-clothing.
